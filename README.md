# Welcome to the starter frontend ðŸ˜€

This is a mock website to show to our client to see about the MVP and if there is anything the client likes or changes.

## Features

-   Dashboard page where view button links so the view page for the inventory
-   Grid look which displays the items with their image and formal name
-   List look which displays more information in a table style
-   Grid or list view the user can click on an item to show a popup to tell more about the item
-   Grid/List Toggle to switch between the different views
-   Search bar for filtering the items in grid and list view

## Working

-   List View Mobile View (I'm gonna wait for a table design cause idk how to make a table for phone to look good XD)

## Moving from mockup to... production

Assuming we are moving into Node.JS/PHP

-   HTML Sections or Pages can be turned into routes
-   CSS can be SCSS or different files separated from main file for better organization or easier to find and edit
-   JS can be separated to multiple files for better read
